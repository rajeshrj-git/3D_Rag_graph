# Knowledge Graph RAG System

This project is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates knowledge graph creation with document-based query answering. It uses Neo4j as the graph database, Groq's ChatGroq for language processing, and Hugging Face embeddings for document vectorization. The system allows for document upload, knowledge extraction, and querying with visual representation of relationships in a 3D graph format.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Upload a PDF document to extract entities and relationships.
- **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Automatically generates a knowledge graph based on extracted entities and relationships from the document.
- **Query Interface**: Ask questions based on the uploaded document, and retrieve both a generated answer and knowledge graph connections.
- **3D Graph Visualization**: Interactive 3D visualization of the knowledge graph using Plotly.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **Neo4j**: A graph database to store and query relationships.
- **Groq's ChatGroq**: For language processing and relationship extraction.
- **Hugging Face Embeddings**: For document vectorization and similarity-based retrieval.
- **Plotly**: To visualize relationships in a 3D graph.
- **LangChain**: To handle document loading, splitting, and RAG operations.
